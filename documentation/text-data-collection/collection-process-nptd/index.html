					<h3>Collection Process - Non-Plain Text Data</h3>
					<p>
						This section describes in detail how the items were collected for those sources that were not available as plain text files. In these cases we relied on online subscriptions including daily downloads of issues, or in cases online descriptions were not possible direct purchases in the country of publication by an academic collaborator and subsequent shipment of the collected issues to Germany. The different venues of purchase including the strategies we used to fill gaps are presented in the table below.
