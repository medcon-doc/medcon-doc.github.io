					<h3>Expert Survey</h3>
					<p>
						This section gives a description of the online survey conducted to gather the expert input for the selection of media outlets.
					</p>
					<p>
						In each country, experts rated a list of media outlets for each media type provided by the MedCon researcher team in regard to their reach and relevance within the national political discourse. Experts could also suggest further outlets that were not listed but were relevant in their opinion. Based on the rankings of media outlets provided by the experts we included at least two daily newspapers, five news websites, and five political blogs for each country. The consolidated list of sources is provided in the next section.
					</p>
					<p>
						Note: We did not include televised media outlets in this study. Their audiovisual character complicates comparisons with text-based media content. Furthermore, the broadcasting systems in the different countries vary more than the text-based media systems for example in regard to their journalistic orientation (opinionated vs. non-opinionated) and their economic conditions of production (public service broadcasting vs. private broadcasting). Such variance is, through the focus on text-based media, kept as constant as possible in this study. In cases of external pluralism we made sure to consider this in final media outlet selection.
